# Cmen-TCPChat
this is a simple TCP program and allow you to chat to each other remotely.

## Introduction
Here's still some little defect. However, I believe that it's absolutely a very simple tcp-chat-program. 
You can use this program as server-end or client-end by args. 
If you choose client, you should input IP and port to connect.
If you choose server, you only need to specify a port.

## Defects
* Not serious in data dealing
* Not pay lots of attention to the appearance of User Interface
* No comment inside
